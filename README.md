I’m a Machine Learning/MLOps engineer with 6+ YOE, with solid career in the banking sector currently enrolled in Data Science master studies at Universidade do Porto, expecting to finish it in 2027.

Currently, I’m based in Portugal working as a machine engineer at Millennium BCP, the leading private bank in the country, where we’re pioneering a more trustworthy, fast, responsive, and scalable banking environment. Here, I assist my team in identifying, and implementing more secure and reliable services, utilizing tools such as Python, C#, Kubernetes, Kafka, Docker, Databricks and Spark, besides routines related to model deployment, serving and monitoring. 

In my free time, I’m always developing some project related to NBA and machine learning, sometimes a chatbot to deepen on NLP and Langchain studies, sometimes a predictor to focus on deep learning. Also, In academic field I also carry a Stanford's Machine Learning program by Andrew Ng and an IBM's Data Engineer professional certificate.
